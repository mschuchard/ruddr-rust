# ruddr-rust
`ruddr-rust` is a crate representing a lightweight/hobbyist SDK for Rust. The creator/maintainer will only ever implement support for `Read` and `List` operations i.e. `GET`, and will also only ever support certain endpoints and parameters personally considered of greater importance.

Please see the official Rust crate documentation page at FORTHCOMING for usage.

This crate is currently released as alpha, and will not be published as a crate until transitioned to beta.
