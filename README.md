# ruddr-rust
`ruddr-rust` is a crate representing a lightweight Rust SDK for [Ruddr](https://www.ruddr.io). The creator/maintainer will only ever implement support for `Read` and `List` operations i.e. `GET`, and will also only ever support certain endpoints and parameters personally considered of greater importance.

Please see the official Rust [crate documentation page](https://docs.rs/ruddr) for usage.

This crate is currently published as a release candidate.
